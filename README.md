OpenLayers
==========

*OpenLayers v2.13.1*

I created this repository to quickly pull in a basic OpenLayers build into new projects using bower.  For production code, the full build and installation process can be found at [here](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers)

## Installation

Add this line to your `bower.json` file:

`'openlayers': 'https://github.com/louiswilbrink/openlayers'`

On the command line, enter:

`bower install`

Then add this link in your index.html file

`<script src="bower_components/OpenLayers.js"></script>`
